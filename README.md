# JavierMorales-Portfolio-Project
Portfolios are used by professionals to highlight their best work, skills and potential.

In this activity we were challenged to create a website that showcases our experience and skills in a portfolio.
i creted this website from cratch and this is how i approached this activity.

The first tep was to create a "base" so i created my HTML adding only the basic tags such as body and head 
, next i added semantic elements to help with flow as well as readibility , indentation followed.

i proceeded to add content to my page, adding "divs" into my "section" tags to separate into even smaller bites.

All of the images were added onto the HTML file.

The next step was to create my CSS file where i would add styling to my HTML ddocument, media queries had been added, flex was implemented onto this file.

The last step was to push my code into my Github account.
